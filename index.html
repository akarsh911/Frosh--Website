        <div class="about_info">
            <p>Frosh is a vibrant and enthusiastic group of individuals dedicated to welcoming the
                first-year students of
                TIET with open arms. The Society is committed to ensuring that the transition from high school to
                university is smooth
                and enjoyable for all students, and works tirelessly to provide them with the necessary support and
                resources to achieve
                success.
                <br>
                At Frosh Week Society, we understand that the first year of university can be overwhelming and daunting,
                which is why we
                are committed to making the experience as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. Our team of experienced
                volunteers is
                always on hand to provide guidance and support, whether it be through in-person counselling, organising
                orientation
                programs, or answering any questions students may have through our infodesk.
                <br>
                Our most exciting event of the year is undoubtedly the Frosh Week, a week-long celebration of all things
                first-year!
                During Frosh Week, students get the opportunity to meet their peers, explore the campus, and take part
                in a range of
                exciting activities and events designed to promote social integration and foster a sense of community.
                From fun
                icebreaker games to informative campus tours, Frosh Week has something for everyone.
                <br>
                We are passionate about making a positive impact on the lives of first-year students, and we believe
                that our efforts
                help to create a welcoming and inclusive community that fosters academic and personal growth. By joining
                Frosh Week
                Society, students not only get to experience the excitement and camaraderie of Frosh Week, but also have
                the chance to
                make meaningful connections and contribute to the success of their fellow classmates.
                <br>
                In short, Frosh Week Society is more than just a group of volunteers â€“ we are a community dedicated to
                helping new
                students adjust to university life, and to ensuring that their first year is one of excitement, growth,
                and success.
